# SCCHS-Monopoly

@Description
SCCHS Monopoly is a simple game using courses from the Saskatchewan curriculum. It was made as a practicle example to help teach object 
orientated programing in python3 to fellow classmates in my Computer Science 30 class. It was also used to demonstrate how loops and conditional
statements can be used to create flow in a program.
